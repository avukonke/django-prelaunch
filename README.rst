Django-Prelaunch
================

While developing the next Facebook, you want to get some buzz going, get beta-testers and start building your list of interested people. This app lets you do that.

Prelaunch provides you with a couple of tools to put up a simple buzz-generating and information-gathering setup. You get:

Current functionality:
----------------------
* A simple signup form asking for email. This gets stored.
* A referral code for each signup, used to refer other people to the site.
* Tracking of the referral code, so that you see prolific referrers.

Future functionality:
---------------------
* Admin functionality to convert prelaunch emails to user accounts.
* Hooks to automatically create user accounts after a specified number of referrals.
